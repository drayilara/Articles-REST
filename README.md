# Articles-REST
A very simple REST API for sharing articles across the web.
This API does not have a UI, so to send requests other than GET,you will need POSTMAN

# Tools used
The API was built with node.js and mongoDB.
When it receives a GET request, it returns an array of JSON data.
Parse the data to get a circular object

#Supported HTTP verbs
GET,POST,PATCH,PUT,DELETE.

#Run npm init upon cloning to get all dependecies
